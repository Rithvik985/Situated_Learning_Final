File: question_01_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 7
Reason: The content contains a single main question with 7 distinct sub-questions (a to g) that are related to the sensor datasheet, and there are no sets or variations of the same question. Each sub-question is considered part of the main question, but since they are distinct and separate, they are counted individually.
Text Length: 661 chars
Action: Splitting into 7 separate files
Split Result: Failed, keeping original

File: question_02_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question ("For the circuit shown, answer the following questions") with sub-questions (a, b, c, d, e) that are part of it, and there are no sets (e.g. "SET A", "SET B") indicating multiple variants of the same question.
Text Length: 541 chars
Action: Keep as is
